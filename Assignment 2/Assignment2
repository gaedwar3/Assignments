// 		Lecture: MWF: 8:35 - 9:25 am 
//  Description: A program that reads inputs and finds the largest integer, the number of negative integers 
//               in the sequence, the largest even integer in the sequence, and sum of numbers divisible by 3 then
// 				 outputs the results of those calculations once the number 0 is entered

		int sum = 0; 
		int largestEven = 0;

		while (number != 0) { // code runs until 0 is input

			if (number % 2 == 0 && number > largestEven) { // if number is even and larger than the largestEven
				largestEven = number; // replace largestEven with that number
			}

			if (number > largestInt) { // if number is greater than the largestInt 
				largestInt = number;   // largestInt becomes the said number
